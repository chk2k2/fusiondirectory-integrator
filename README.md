## IRC Etiquette

* If we don't answer right away then just hang out in the channel.  Someone will
  eventually write back to you as it just means we are away from keyboard,
  working on something else, or in a different timezone than you.

* You should treat IRC as what it is: asynchronous chat.  Sure the messages can
  be instant but in most channels people are in different time zones.  At times
  chat replies can be in excess of 24hrs.
